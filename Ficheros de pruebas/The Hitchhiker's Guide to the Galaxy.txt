Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public
library. The old man frowned as they stepped in.

- Terribly unfortunate, - he said, - a diode blew in one of the life-support
computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered they'd been
dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who's going to clear away the bodies,
that's what I want to know. Look why don't you sit yourself down over there
and let me plug you in?

He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out
of the rib cage of a stegosaurus.

- It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus, - explained the old man
as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper
and drawing instruments. - Here, - he said, - hold these, - and passed a couple
of stripped wire end to Arthur.

The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him.

He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself. Beneath him
was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as far as the eye could see
were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse
for wear - many were cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was
shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation
that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact
that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited
people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering
in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air.

Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so
much as a body to his name, but before he had time to reflect on this a voice
rang out across the square and called for everyone's attention.

A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly
dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a Tannoy.

- O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought! - he cried out. -
Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most
Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The Time of Waiting
is over!

Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and wolf whistles
sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled
over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air.

- Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and
Hopefully Enlightening Day! - cried the cheer leader. - The Day of the Answer!

Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd.

- Never again, - cried the man, - never again will we wake up in the morning
and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically
speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work? For today we will finally
learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little
problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!

As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the
air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the first floor of the
building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd.

He experienced a moment's panic as he sailed straight through towards the
window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right
through the solid glass without apparently touching it.

No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly sur-
prising as he wasn't there. He began to realize that the whole experience was
merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a
cocked hat.

The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven and a half
million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century
or so. The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded
now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk's leather
top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday.

Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited.

- The time is nearly upon us, - said one, and Arthur was surprised to see
a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's neck. The word was
Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple of times and the disappeared again. Before
Arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word Phouchg
appeared by his neck.

- Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in
motion, - the second man said, - and in all that time we will be the first to hear
the computer speak.

- An awesome prospect, Phouchg, - agreed the first man, and Arthur sud-
denly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles.

- We are the ones who will hear, - said Phouchg, - the answer to the great
question of Life!..

- The Universe!.. - said Loonquawl.

- And Everything!..

- Shhh, - said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, - I think Deep Thought is
preparing to speak!

There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on
the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled
down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication
channel.

- Good morning, - said Deep Thought at last.

- Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought, - said Loonquawl nervously, - do
you have... er, that is...

- An answer for you? - interrupted Deep Thought majestically. - Yes. I
have.

The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.

- There really is one? - breathed Phouchg.

- There really is one, - confirmed Deep Thought.

- To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Every-
thing?

- Yes.

Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a
preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the
answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited
children.

- And you're ready to give it to us? - urged Loonquawl.

- I am.

- Now?

- Now, - said Deep Thought.

They both licked their dry lips.

- Though I don't think, - added Deep Thought, - that you're going to like
it.

- Doesn't matter! - said Phouchg. - We must know it! Now!

- Now? - inquired Deep Thought.

- Yes! Now...

- Alright, - said the computer and settled into silence again. The two men
fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.

- You're really not going to like it, - observed Deep Thought.

- Tell us!

- Alright, - said Deep Thought. - The Answer to the Great Question...

- Yes!..

- Of Life, the Universe and Everything... - said Deep Thought.

- Yes!..

- Is... - said Deep Thought, and paused.

- Yes!..

- Is...

- Yes!!!?..

- Forty-two, - said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.
